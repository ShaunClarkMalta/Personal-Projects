# Dhaeris' Spellbook :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

### About
This was one of the first projects I created on my own. I have recently became interested in Dungeons and Dragons and have been playing for a while. Through a convoluted set of circumstances, I am now a Dungeon Master for a Campaign. One player (who was to be named Dhaeris, hence the name) decided that he wanted to be a Wizard and, starting at a higher level, meant that I wanted to give him a couple of new spells that he might have found prior to the beginning of the campaign.

Whilst I could have just rolled a dice randomly, or even asked him to pick them himself, I decided to use my knowledge of Python to create a spellbook of sorts.

### Functions 🧐
The spellbook has various functions. It has (or will have eventually) a list of all the spells in game so as to choose from, when I get around to adding them all.
- :books: - An option to view the Complete Spell Lists for each class 
- ✨ - A collection of all the spells that you have collected so far 
- ➕ - A function to add specific spells to your spell lists 
- ❓ - An option to add an amount of random spells to your spellbook 
- 🎲 - A random scroll generator, based on spell list type and level 
- ❌ - An option to remove spells from the book

### Future Improvements
With the knowledge I have now, I would probably change the way that I originally made this program. 
- 🔄 - **Data Overhaul** - Instead of having nested lists/ arrays, I might use a dictionary and store each spells as a dictionary element. This would mean that ultimately, I would need less space as ech element would have certain tags to make searching easier
- 📁 - **Complete Database** - I would need to expand the database to include spells of all levels 
- 📝 - **Spell Descriptions** - I would add spell descriptions, but I am not sure of the Copyright policies that would imply
- 💾 - **Save/Load Functionality** - Have a Save/ Load function
- 🪟 - **User Interface** - Use an actual User Interface, rather than CLI style menus

### Final Thoughts 💭
What began as a simple, silly task, evolved into something more that allowed me to put time, energy and dedication to. It also reaised my spirits and provided me with new insights as to how to tackle problems, whilst allowing me to practice and evolve.
