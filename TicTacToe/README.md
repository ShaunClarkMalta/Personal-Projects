# Tic-Tac-Toe 🎮

### About
This is a simple two-player version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, created as part of a [Udemy Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/?kw=python+hero&src=sac). The game runs in the command-line interface (CLI) and does not include any AI, as it was designed for two human players to enjoy.

At the time of development, I had no knowledge of graphics programming, so the interface is purely text-based. The project was originally written in a *Jupyter Notebook*, so it may require some formatting adjustments to run seamlessly as a standalone Python script.
